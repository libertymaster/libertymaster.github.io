<h2>Ron Paul's Infamous "What If" Speech</h2>

<p>Transcript</p>
<p>The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under a previous order of the House, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. PAUL) is recognized for 5 minutes.
			<br/>
			<br/>
Mr. PAUL. Madam Speaker, I have a few questions for my colleagues.
			<br/>
			<br/>
What if our foreign policy of the past century is deeply flawed and has not served our national security interests?
			<br/>
			<br/>
What if we wake up one day and realize that the terrorist threat is a predictable consequence of our meddling in the affairs of 
			<br/>
			<br/>
others and has nothing to do with us being free and prosperous?
			<br/>
			<br/>
What if propping up repressive regimes in the Middle East endangers both the United States and Israel?
			<br/>
			<br/>
What if occupying countries like Iraq and Afghanistan—and bombing Pakistan—is directly related to the hatred directed towards us?
			<br/>
			<br/>
What if some day it dawns on us that losing over 5,000 American military personnel in the Middle East since 9/11 is not a fair 
			<br/>
			<br/>
trade-off for the loss of nearly 3,000 American citizens...
			<br/>
			<br/>
No matter how many Iraqi, Pakistani, and Afghan people are killed or displaced?
			<br/>
			<br/>
What if we finally decide that torture—even if called ‘‘enhanced interrogation techniques’’—is self-destructive and produces no 
			<br/>
			<br/>
useful information and that contracting it out to a third world nation is just as evil?
			<br/>
			<br/>
What if it is finally realized that war and military spending is always destructive to the economy?
			<br/>
			<br/>
What if all wartime spending is paid for through the deceitful and evil process of inflating and borrowing?
			<br/>
			<br/>
What if we finally see that wartime conditions always undermine personal liberty?
			<br/>
			<br/>
What if conservatives, who preach small government, wake up and realize that our interventionist foreign policy provides the 
			<br/>
			<br/>
greatest incentive to expand the government?
			<br/>
			<br/>
What if conservatives understood once again that their only logical position is to reject military intervention and managing an 
			<br/>
			<br/>
empire throughout the world?
			<br/>
			<br/>
What if the American people woke up and understood the official reasons for going to war are almost always based on lies and 
			<br/>
			<br/>
promoted by war propaganda in order to serve special interests?
			<br/>
			<br/>
What if we, as a Nation, came to realize that the quest for empire eventually destroys all great nations?
			<br/>
			<br/>
What if Obama has no intention of leaving Iraq?
			<br/>
			<br/>
What if a military draft is being planned for the wars that will spread if our foreign policy is not changed?
			<br/>
			<br/>
What if the American people learn the truth: that our foreign policy has nothing to do with national security and it never 
			<br/>
			<br/>
changes from one administration to the next?
			<br/>
			<br/>
What if war and preparation for war is a racket serving the special interests?
			<br/>
			<br/>
What if President Obama is completely wrong about Afghanistan and it turns out worse than Iraq and Vietnam put together?
			<br/>
			<br/>
What if Christianity actually teaches peace and not preventive wars of aggression?
			<br/>
			<br/>
What if diplomacy is found to be superior to bombs and bribes in protecting America?
			<br/>
			<br/>
What happens if my concerns are completely unfounded? Nothing.
			<br/>
			<br/>
But what happens if my concerns are justified and ignored? Nothing good.</p>

<h2>Ron Paul's Farewell Speech to Congress</h2>

<p>Transcript</p>
<p>On November 14, 2012, retiring Rep. Ron Paul (R-Texas) gave his farewell speech to Congress.</p>

<p>In a public career that included three stints in Congress (1976-1977; 1979-1985; and 1997-present) and a run for president as the Libertarian Candidate (1988), no living elected official has done more to advance the ideals of limited government and a libertarian approach to federal government.</p>

<p>His longshot bids for the Republican presidential nomination in 2008 and 2012 radically altered the national conversation on entitlements, fiscal and monetary policy, foreign policy, and crony capitalism, and his success with online fundraising and organization has set the example that others will be following for years to come. The groups he has created, including Young Americans for Liberty and Campaign for Liberty, will continue to grow in size and influence.</p>

<p>Paul used his final address in the House of Representatives to draw attention to growing violations of civil liberties, a chronic economic crisis brought on out-of-control government spending and debt, the ease with which the country goes to (undeclared) war, and the immoral willingness to use violence to achieve desired social ends.</p>

<p>As Paul's biographer, Reason staffer Brian Doherty, noted, Ron Paul is "a true American original. No politician talks like this, and I suspect it will be a long time before another does. Ideas like this will be much harder to find in the House of Representatives with Paul gone, and we will all be the poorer for it."</p>

<p>Go to http://reason.com/tags/ron-paul for Reason's coverage of the congressman known as "Dr. No" for his refusal to sanction legislation the he felt was not authorized by the U.S. Constitution.</p>
