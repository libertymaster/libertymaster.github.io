    <h4>The Presidential Election of 2008</h4>
    <p>Once upon a time there was a real-deal statesman in Washington D.C. For he was truly a man of the people. He spoke the truth regardless of whether it was popular or not. And he continued to do so despite the attacks against him and his honesty. As for we the people, the realization came quite quickly (at least for those of us who were paying attention) that speaking the truth becomes treason within an empire of lies. The patriots are labeled crazy or even terrorists by the psychopaths and terrorists who became the rulers. On one hand, liberty is stolen from the people by the tyrants. On the other hand, maybe the people end up with the government they deserve. Truly, when the government is overrun with liars and thieves, truth is treason in an empire of lies.</p>

    <p>Transcript</p>
    <p>The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under a previous order of the House, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. PAUL) is recognized for 5 minutes.
			<br>
			<br>
Mr. PAUL. Madam Speaker, I have a few questions for my colleagues.
			<br>
			<br>
What if our foreign policy of the past century is deeply flawed and has not served our national security interests?
			<br>
			<br>
What if we wake up one day and realize that the terrorist threat is a predictable consequence of our meddling in the affairs of 
			<br>
			<br>
others and has nothing to do with us being free and prosperous?
			<br>
			<br>
What if propping up repressive regimes in the Middle East endangers both the United States and Israel?
			<br>
			<br>
What if occupying countries like Iraq and Afghanistan—and bombing Pakistan—is directly related to the hatred directed towards us?
			<br>
			<br>
What if some day it dawns on us that losing over 5,000 American military personnel in the Middle East since 9/11 is not a fair 
			<br>
			<br>
trade-off for the loss of nearly 3,000 American citizens...
			<br>
			<br>
No matter how many Iraqi, Pakistani, and Afghan people are killed or displaced?
			<br>
			<br>
What if we finally decide that torture—even if called ‘‘enhanced interrogation techniques’’—is self-destructive and produces no 
			<br>
			<br>
useful information and that contracting it out to a third world nation is just as evil?
			<br>
			<br>
What if it is finally realized that war and military spending is always destructive to the economy?
			<br>
			<br>
What if all wartime spending is paid for through the deceitful and evil process of inflating and borrowing?
			<br>
			<br>
What if we finally see that wartime conditions always undermine personal liberty?
			<br>
			<br>
What if conservatives, who preach small government, wake up and realize that our interventionist foreign policy provides the 
			<br>
			<br>
greatest incentive to expand the government?
			<br>
			<br>
What if conservatives understood once again that their only logical position is to reject military intervention and managing an 
			<br>
			<br>
empire throughout the world?
			<br>
			<br>
What if the American people woke up and understood the official reasons for going to war are almost always based on lies and 
			<br>
			<br>
promoted by war propaganda in order to serve special interests?
			<br>
			<br>
What if we, as a Nation, came to realize that the quest for empire eventually destroys all great nations?
			<br>
			<br>
What if Obama has no intention of leaving Iraq?
			<br>
			<br>
What if a military draft is being planned for the wars that will spread if our foreign policy is not changed?
			<br>
			<br>
What if the American people learn the truth: that our foreign policy has nothing to do with national security and it never 
			<br>
			<br>
changes from one administration to the next?
			<br>
			<br>
What if war and preparation for war is a racket serving the special interests?
			<br>
			<br>
What if President Obama is completely wrong about Afghanistan and it turns out worse than Iraq and Vietnam put together?
			<br>
			<br>
What if Christianity actually teaches peace and not preventive wars of aggression?
			<br>
			<br>
What if diplomacy is found to be superior to bombs and bribes in protecting America?
			<br>
			<br>
What happens if my concerns are completely unfounded? Nothing.
			<br>
			<br>
But what happens if my concerns are justified and ignored? Nothing good.</p>

    <h4>Ron Paul's Farewell Speech to Congress</h4>
    <p>November 16, 2012</p>
    <p>On November 14, 2012, retiring Rep. Ron Paul (R-Texas) gave his farewell speech to Congress.</p>
    <p>In a public career that included three stints in Congress (1976-1977; 1979-1985; and 1997-present) and a run for president as the Libertarian Candidate (1988), no living elected official has done more to advance the ideals of limited government and a libertarian approach to federal government.</p>
    <p>His longshot bids for the Republican presidential nomination in 2008 and 2012 radically altered the national conversation on entitlements, fiscal and monetary policy, foreign policy, and crony capitalism, and his success with online fundraising and organization has set the example that others will be following for years to come. The groups he has created, including Young Americans for Liberty and Campaign for Liberty, will continue to grow in size and influence.</p>
    <p>Paul used his final address in the House of Representatives to draw attention to growing violations of civil liberties, a chronic economic crisis brought on out-of-control government spending and debt, the ease with which the country goes to (undeclared) war, and the immoral willingness to use violence to achieve desired social ends.</p>
    <p>As Paul's biographer, Reason staffer Brian Doherty, noted, Ron Paul is "a true American original. No politician talks like this, and I suspect it will be a long time before another does. Ideas like this will be much harder to find in the House of Representatives with Paul gone, and we will all be the poorer for it."</p>

<p>Transcript of Ron Paul's Farewell Address to Congress:</p>
<p>November 14, 2012</p>
<p>The gentleman from Texas, Mr Paul, is recognized for 60 minutes as the design of the majority
leader. I thank you Mr. Speaker. I ask unanimous consent to revise and extend my remarks. Without objection so ordered.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, This may well be the last time I speak on the House Floor. At the end of the year I’ll leave Congress
after 23 years in office over a 36 year period. My goals in 1976 were the same as they are today:
promote peace and prosperity by a strict adherence to the principles of individual liberty.</p>

<p>It was my opinion, that the course the U.S. embarked on in the latter part of the 20th Century would
bring us a major financial crisis and engulf us in a foreign policy that would overextend us and
undermine our national security.</p>

<p>To achieve the goals I sought, government would have had to shrink in size and scope, reduce
spending, change the monetary system, and reject the unsustainable costs of policing the world and
expanding the American Empire.</p>

<p>The problems seemed to be overwhelming and impossible to solve, yet from my view point, just
following the constraints placed on the federal government by the Constitution would have been a
good place to start.</p>

<p>How Much Did I Accomplish? In many ways, according to conventional wisdom, my off-and-on career in Congress, from 1976 to
2012, accomplished very little. No named legislation, no named federal buildings or highways—thank
goodness. In spite of my efforts, the government has grown exponentially, taxes remain excessive,
and the prolific increase of incomprehensible regulations continues. Wars are constant and pursued
without Congressional declaration, deficits rise to the sky, poverty is rampant and dependency on the
federal government is now worse than any time in our history.</p>

<p>All this with minimal concerns for the deficits and unfunded liabilities that common sense tells us
cannot go on much longer. A grand, but never mentioned, bipartisan agreement allows for the well-
kept secret that keeps the spending going. One side doesn’t give up one penny on military spending,
the other side doesn’t give up one penny on welfare spending, while both sides support the bailouts
and subsidies for the banking and corporate elite. And the spending continues as the economy
weakens and the downward spiral continues. As the government continues fiddling around, our
liberties and our wealth burn in the flames of a foreign policy that makes us less safe.</p>

<p>The major stumbling block to real change in Washington is the total resistance to admitting that the
country is broke. This has made compromising, just to agree to increase spending, inevitable since
neither side has any intention of cutting spending.</p>

<p>The country and the Congress will remain divisive since there’s no “loot left to divvy up.”</p>

<p>Without this recognition the spenders in Washington will continue the march toward a fiscal cliff much
bigger than the one anticipated this coming January.</p>

<p>I have thought a lot about why those of us who believe in liberty, as a solution, have done so poorly in
convincing others of its benefits. If liberty is what we claim it is- the principle that protects all personal,
social and economic decisions necessary for maximum prosperity and the best chance for peace- it
should be an easy sell. Yet, history has shown that the masses have been quite receptive to the
promises of authoritarians which are rarely if ever fulfilled.</p>

<p>If authoritarianism leads to poverty and war and less freedom for all individuals and is controlled by
rich special interests, the people should be begging for liberty. There certainly was a strong enough
sentiment for more freedom at the time of our founding that motivated those who were willing to fight
in the revolution against the powerful British government.</p>

<p>During my time in Congress the appetite for liberty has been quite weak; the understanding of its
significance negligible. Yet the good news is that compared to 1976 when I first came to Congress,
the desire for more freedom and less government in 2012 is much greater and growing, especially in
grassroots America. Tens of thousands of teenagers and college age students are, with great
enthusiasm, welcoming the message of liberty.</p>

<p>I have a few thoughts as to why the people of a country like ours, once the freest and most
prosperous, allowed the conditions to deteriorate to the degree that they have.</p>

<p>Freedom, private property, and enforceable voluntary contracts, generate wealth. In our early history
we were very much aware of this. But in the early part of the 20th century our politicians promoted the
notion that the tax and monetary systems had to change if we were to involve ourselves in excessive
domestic and military spending. That is why Congress gave us the Federal Reserve and the income
tax. The majority of Americans and many government officials agreed that sacrificing some liberty
was necessary to carry out what some claimed to be “progressive” ideas. Pure democracy became
acceptable.</p>

<p>They failed to recognized that what they were doing was exactly opposite of what the colonists were
seeking when they broke away from the British.</p>

<p>Some complain that my arguments makes no sense, since great wealth and the standard of living
improved for many Americans over the last 100 years, even with these new policies.</p>

<p>But the damage to the market economy, and the currency, has been insidious and steady. It took a
long time to consume our wealth, destroy the currency and undermine productivity and get our
financial obligations to a point of no return. Confidence sometimes lasts longer than deserved. Most of
our wealth today depends on debt.</p>

<p>The wealth that we enjoyed and seemed to be endless, allowed concern for the principle of a free
society to be neglected. As long as most people believed the material abundance would last forever,
worrying about protecting a competitive productive economy and individual liberty seemed
unnecessary.</p>

<p>This neglect ushered in an age of redistribution of wealth by government kowtowing to any and all
special interests, except for those who just wanted to left alone. That is why today money in politics
far surpasses money currently going into research and development and productive entrepreneurial
efforts.</p>

<p>The material benefits became more important than the understanding and promoting the principles of
liberty and a free market. It is good that material abundance is a result of liberty but if materialism is
all that we care about, problems are guaranteed.</p>

<p>The crisis arrived because the illusion that wealth and prosperity would last forever has ended. Since
it was based on debt and a pretense that debt can be papered over by an out-of-control fiat monetary
system, it was doomed to fail. We have ended up with a system that doesn’t produce enough even to
finance the debt and no fundamental understanding of why a free society is crucial to reversing these
trends.</p>

<p>If this is not recognized, the recovery will linger for a long time. Bigger government, more spending,
more debt, more poverty for the middle class, and a more intense scramble by the elite special
interests will continue.</p>

<p>Without an intellectual awakening, the turning point will be driven by economic law. A dollar crisis will
bring the current out-of-control system to its knees.</p>

<p>If it’s not accepted that big government, fiat money, ignoring liberty, central economic planning,
welfarism, and warfarism caused our crisis we can expect a continuous and dangerous march toward
corporatism and even fascism with even more loss of our liberties. Prosperity for a large middle class
though will become an abstract dream.</p>

<p>This continuous move is no different than what we have seen in how our financial crisis of 2008 was
handled. Congress first directed, with bipartisan support, bailouts for the wealthy. Then it was the
Federal Reserve with its endless quantitative easing. If at first it doesn’t succeed try again; QE1, QE2,
and QE3 and with no results we try QE indefinitely—that is until it too fails. There’s a cost to all of this
and let me assure you delaying the payment is no longer an option. The rules of the market will
extract its pound of flesh and it won’t be pretty.</p>

<p>The current crisis elicits a lot of pessimism. And the pessimism adds to less confidence in the future.
The two feed on themselves, making our situation worse.</p>

<p>If the underlying cause of the crisis is not understood we cannot solve our problems. The issues of
warfare, welfare, deficits, inflationism, corporatism, bailouts and authoritarianism cannot be ignored.
By only expanding these policies we cannot expect good results.</p>

<p>Everyone claims support for freedom. But too often it’s for one’s own freedom and not for others. Too
many believe that there must be limits on freedom. They argue that freedom must be directed and
managed to achieve fairness and equality thus making it acceptable to curtail, through force, certain
liberties.</p>

<p>Some decide what and whose freedoms are to be limited. These are the politicians whose goal in life
is power. Their success depends on gaining support from special interests.</p>

<p>The great news is the answer is not to be found in more “isms.” The answers are to be found in more
liberty which cost so much less. Under these circumstances spending goes down, wealth production
goes up, and the quality of life improves.</p>

<p>Just this recognition—especially if we move in this direction—increases optimism which in itself is
beneficial. The follow through with sound policies are required which must be understood and
supported by the people.</p>

<p>But there is good evidence that the generation coming of age at the present time is supportive of
moving in the direction of more liberty and self-reliance. The more this change in direction and the
solutions become known, the quicker will be the return of optimism.</p>

<p>Our job, for those of us who believe that a different system than the one that we have had for the
last 100 years, has driven us to this unsustainable crisis, is to be more convincing that there is a
wonderful, uncomplicated, and moral system that provides the answers. We had a taste of it in our
early history. We need not give up on the notion of advancing this cause.</p>

<p>It worked, but we allowed our leaders to concentrate on the material abundance that freedom
generates, while ignoring freedom itself. Now we have neither, but the door is open, out of necessity,
for an answer. The answer available is based on the Constitution, individual liberty and prohibiting the
use of government force to provide privileges and benefits to all special interests.</p>

<p>After over 100 years we face a society quite different from the one that was intended by the
Founders. In many ways their efforts to protect future generations with the Constitution from this
danger has failed. Skeptics, at the time the Constitution was written in 1787, warned us of today’s
possible outcome. The insidious nature of the erosion of our liberties and the reassurance our great
abundance gave us, allowed the process to evolve into the dangerous period in which we now live.</p>

<p>Today we face a dependency on government largesse for almost every need. Our liberties are
restricted and government operates outside the rule of law, protecting and rewarding those who buy
or coerce government into satisfying their demands.</p> 

<p>Here are a few examples:</p>

<p>Undeclared wars are commonplace.</p>

<p>Welfare for the rich and poor is considered an entitlement.</p>

<p>The economy is overregulated, overtaxed and grossly distorted by a deeply flawed monetary system.</p>

<p>Debt is growing exponentially.</p>

<p>The Patriot Act and FISA legislation passed without much debate have resulted in a steady erosion of our 4th Amendment rights.</p>

<p>Tragically our government engages in preemptive war, otherwise known as aggression, with no complaints from the American people.</p>

<p>The drone warfare we are pursuing worldwide is destined to end badly for us as the hatred builds for innocent lives lost and the international laws flaunted.</p> 

<p>Once we are financially weakened and militarily challenged, there will be a lot resentment thrown our way.</p>

<p>It’s now the law of the land that the military can arrest American citizens, hold them indefinitely, without charges or a trial.</p>

<p>Rampant hostility toward free trade is supported by a large number in Washington.</p>

<p>Supporters of sanctions, currency manipulation and WTO trade retaliation, call the true free-traders “isolationists.”</p>

<p>Sanctions are used to punish countries that don’t follow our orders.</p>

<p>Bailouts and guarantees for all kinds of misbehavior are routine.</p>

<p>Central economic planning through monetary policy, regulations and legislative mandates has been an acceptable policy.</p>

<p>Excessive government has created such a mess it prompts many questions:</p>

<p>Why are sick people who use medical marijuana put in prison?</p>

<p>Why does the federal government restrict the drinking of raw milk?</p>

<p>Why can’t Americans manufacture rope and other products from hemp?</p>

<p>Why are Americans not allowed to use gold and silver as legal tender as mandated by the Constitution?</p>

<p>Why is Germany concerned enough to consider repatriating their gold held by the FED for her in New York?</p>

<p>Is it that the trust in the U.S. and dollar supremacy beginning to wane?</p>

<p>Why do our political leaders believe it’s unnecessary to thoroughly audit our own gold?</p>

<p>Why can’t Americans decide which type of light bulbs they can buy?</p>

<p>Why is the TSA permitted to abuse the rights of any American traveling by air?</p>

<p>Why should there be mandatory sentences—even up to life for crimes without victims—as our drug laws require?</p>

<p>Why have we allowed the federal government to regulate commodes in our homes?</p>

<p>Why is it political suicide for anyone to criticize AIPAC ?</p>

<p>Why haven’t we given up on the drug war since it’s an obvious failure and violates the people’s rights?</p>

<p>Has nobody noticed that the authorities can’t even keep drugs out of the prisons?</p>

<p>How can making our entire society a prison solve the problem?</p>

<p>Why do we sacrifice so much getting needlessly involved in border disputes and civil strife around the world and ignore the root cause of the most deadly border in the world-the one between Mexico and the US?</p>

<p>Why does Congress willingly give up its prerogatives to the Executive Branch?</p>

<p>Why does changing the party in power never change policy? Could it be that the views of both parties are essentially the same?</p>

<p>Why did the big banks, the large corporations, and foreign banks and foreign central banks get bailed out in 2008 and the middle class lost their jobs and their homes?</p>

<p>Why do so many in the government and the federal officials believe that creating money out of thin air creates wealth?</p>

<p>Why do so many accept the deeply flawed principle that government bureaucrats and politicians can protect us from ourselves without totally destroying the principle of liberty?</p>

<p>Why can’t people understand that war always destroys wealth and liberty?</p>

<p>Why is there so little concern for the Executive Order that gives the President authority to establish a “kill list,” including American citizens, of those targeted for assassination?</p>

<p>Why is patriotism thought to be blind loyalty to the government and the politicians who run it, rather than loyalty to the principles of liberty and support for the people?</p>

<p>Real patriotism is a willingness to challenge the government when it’s wrong.</p>

<p>Why is it is claimed that if people won’t or can’t take care of their own needs, that people in government can do it for them?</p>

<p>Why did we ever give the government a safe haven for initiating violence against the people?</p>

<p>Why do some members defend free markets, but not civil liberties?</p>

<p>Why do some members defend civil liberties but not free markets? Aren’t they the same?</p>

<p>Why don’t more defend both economic liberty and personal liberty?</p>

<p>Why are there not more individuals who seek to intellectually influence others to bring about positive changes than those who seek power to force others to obey their commands?</p>

<p>Why does the use of religion to support a social gospel and preemptive wars, both of which requires authoritarians to use violence, or the threat of violence, go unchallenged? Aggression and forced redistribution of wealth has nothing to do with the teachings of the world great religions.</p>

<p>Why do we allow the government and the Federal Reserve to disseminate false information dealing with both economic and foreign policy?</p>

<p>Why is democracy held in such high esteem when it’s the enemy of the minority and makes all rights relative to the dictates of the majority?</p>

<p>Why should anyone be surprised that Congress has no credibility, since there’s such a disconnect between what politicians say and what they do?</p>

<p>Is there any explanation for all the deception, the unhappiness, the fear of the future, the loss of confidence in our leaders, the distrust, the anger and frustration? Yes there is, and there’s a way to reverse these attitudes. The negative perceptions are logical and a consequence of bad policies bringing about our problems. Identification of the problems and recognizing the cause allow the proper changes to come easy.</p> 

<p>Too many people have for too long placed too much confidence and trust in government and not enough in themselves. Fortunately, many are now becoming aware of the seriousness of the gross
mistakes of the past several decades. The blame is shared by both political parties. Many Americans
now are demanding to hear the plain truth of things and want the demagoguing to stop. Without this
first step, solutions are impossible.</p>

<p>Seeking the truth and finding the answers in liberty and self-reliance promotes the optimism
necessary for restoring prosperity. The task is not that difficult if politics doesn’t get in the way.</p>

<p>We have allowed ourselves to get into such a mess for various reasons.</p>

<p>Politicians deceive themselves as to how wealth is produced. Excessive confidence is placed in the
judgment of politicians and bureaucrats. This replaces the confidence in a free society. Too many in
high places of authority became convinced that only they, armed with arbitrary government power,
can bring about fairness, while facilitating wealth production. This always proves to be a utopian
dream and destroys wealth and liberty. It impoverishes the people and rewards the special interests
who end up controlling both political parties.</p>

<p>It’s no surprise then that much of what goes on in Washington is driven by aggressive partisanship
and power seeking, with philosophic differences being minor.</p>

<p>Economic ignorance is commonplace. Keynesianism continues to thrive, although today it is facing
healthy and enthusiastic rebuttals. Believers in military Keynesianism and domestic Keynesianism
continue to desperately promote their failed policies, as the economy languishes in a deep slumber.</p>

<p>Supporters of all government edicts use humanitarian arguments to justify them.</p>

<p>Humanitarian arguments are always used to justify government mandates related to the economy,
monetary policy, foreign policy, and personal liberty. This is on purpose to make it more difficult to
challenge. But, initiating violence for humanitarian reasons is still violence. Good intentions are no
excuse and are just as harmful as when people use force with bad intentions. The results are always
negative.</p>

<p>The immoral use of force is the source of man’s political problems. Sadly, many religious groups,
secular organizations, and psychopathic authoritarians endorse government initiated force to change
the world. Even when the desired goals are well-intentioned—or especially when well-intentioned—
the results are dismal. The good results sought never materialize. The new problems created require
even more government force as a solution. The net result is institutionalizing government initiated
violence and morally justifying it on humanitarian grounds.</p>

<p>This is the same fundamental reason our government uses force for invading other countries at will,
central economic planning at home, and the regulation of personal liberty and habits of our citizens.
It is rather strange, that unless one has a criminal mind and no respect for other people and their
property, no one claims it’s permissible to go into one’s neighbor’s house and tell them how to behave,
what they can eat, smoke and drink or how to spend their money.</p>

<p>Yet, rarely is it asked why it is morally acceptable that a stranger with a badge and a gun can do the
same thing in the name of law and order. Any resistance is met with brute force, fines, taxes, arrests,
and even imprisonment. This is done more frequently every day without a proper search warrant.</p>

<p>Restraining aggressive behavior is one thing, but legalizing a government monopoly for initiating
aggression can only lead to exhausting liberty associated with chaos, anger and the breakdown of
civil society. Permitting such authority and expecting saintly behavior from the bureaucrats and the
politicians is a pipe dream. We now have a standing army of armed bureaucrats in the TSA, CIA, FBI,
Fish and Wildlife, FEMA, IRS, Corp of Engineers, etc. numbering over 100,000. Citizens are guilty
until proven innocent in the unconstitutional administrative courts.</p>

<p>Government in a free society should have no authority to meddle in social activities or the economic
transactions of individuals. Nor should government meddle in the affairs of other nations. All things
peaceful, even when controversial, should be permitted.</p>

<p>We must reject the notion of prior restraint in economic activity just we do in the area of free speech
and religious liberty. But even in these areas government is starting to use a backdoor approach of
political correctness to regulate speech-a dangerous trend. Since 9/11 monitoring speech on the
internet is now a problem since warrants are no longer required.</p>

<p>The Constitution established four federal crimes. Today the experts can’t even agree on how many
federal crimes are now on the books—they number into the thousands. No one person can
comprehend the enormity of the legal system—especially the tax code. Due to the ill-advised drug
war and the endless federal expansion of the criminal code we have over 6 million people under
correctional suspension, more than the Soviets ever had, and more than any other nation today,
including China. I don’t understand the complacency of the Congress and the willingness to continue
their obsession with passing more Federal laws. Mandatory sentencing laws associated with drug
laws have compounded our prison problems.</p>

<p>The federal register is now 75,000 pages long and the tax code has 72,000 pages, and expands
every year. When will the people start shouting, “enough is enough,” and demand Congress cease
and desist.</p>

<p>Liberty can only be achieved when government is denied the aggressive use of force.</p>

<p>If one seeks liberty, a precise type of government is needed. To achieve it, more than lip service is required.</p>

<p>Two choices are available.</p>

<p>1. A government designed to protect liberty—a natural right—as its sole objective. The people are
expected to care for themselves and reject the use of any force for interfering with another
person’s liberty. Government is given a strictly limited authority to enforce contracts, property
ownership, settle disputes, and defend against foreign aggression.</p>

<p>2. A government that pretends to protect liberty but is granted power to arbitrarily use force over
the people and foreign nations. Though the grant of power many times is meant to be small and
limited, it inevitably metastasizes into an omnipotent political cancer. This is the problem for
which the world has suffered throughout the ages. Though meant to be limited it nevertheless is
a 100% sacrifice of a principle that would-be-tyrants find irresistible. It is used vigorously—
though incrementally and insidiously. Granting power to government officials always proves the
adage that: “power corrupts.”</p>

<p>Once government gets a limited concession for the use of force to mold people habits and plan the
economy, it causes a steady move toward tyrannical government. Only a revolutionary spirit can
reverse the process and deny to the government this arbitrary use of aggression. There’s no in-
between. Sacrificing a little liberty for imaginary safety always ends badly.</p>

<p>Today’s mess is a result of Americans accepting option #2, even though the Founders attempted to
give us Option #1.</p>

<p>The results are not good. As our liberties have been eroded our wealth has been consumed. The
wealth we see today is based on debt and a foolish willingness on the part of foreigners to take our
dollars for goods and services. They then loan them back to us to perpetuate our debt system. It’s
amazing that it has worked for this long but the impasse in Washington, in solving our problems
indicate that many are starting to understand the seriousness of the world -wide debt crisis and the
dangers we face. The longer this process continues the harsher the outcome will be.</p>

<p>Many are now acknowledging that a financial crisis looms but few understand it’s, in reality, a moral
crisis. It’s the moral crisis that has allowed our liberties to be undermined and permits the exponential
growth of illegal government power. Without a clear understanding of the nature of the crisis it will be
difficult to prevent a steady march toward tyranny and the poverty that will accompany it.</p>

<p>Ultimately, the people have to decide which form of government they want; option #1 or option #2.
There is no other choice. Claiming there is a choice of a “little” tyranny is like describing pregnancy as
a “touch of pregnancy.” It is a myth to believe that a mixture of free markets and government central
economic planning is a worthy compromise. What we see today is a result of that type of thinking.
And the results speak for themselves.</p>

<p>American now suffers from a culture of violence. It’s easy to reject the initiation of violence against
one’s neighbor but it’s ironic that the people arbitrarily and freely anoint government officials with
monopoly power to initiate violence against the American people—practically at will.</p>

<p>Because it’s the government that initiates force, most people accept it as being legitimate. Those who
exert the force have no sense of guilt. It is believed by too many that governments are morally
justified in initiating force supposedly to “do good.” They incorrectly believe that this authority has
come from the “consent of the people.” The minority, or victims of government violence never
consented to suffer the abuse of government mandates, even when dictated by the majority. Victims
of TSA excesses never consented to this abuse.</p>

<p>This attitude has given us a policy of initiating war to “do good,” as well. It is claimed that war, to
prevent war for noble purposes, is justified. This is similar to what we were once told that:
“destroying a village to save a village” was justified. It was said by a US Secretary of State that the
loss of 500,000 Iraqis, mostly children, in the 1990s, as a result of American bombs and sanctions,
was “worth it” to achieve the “good” we brought to the Iraqi people. And look at the mess that Iraq is
in today.</p>

<p>Government use of force to mold social and economic behavior at home and abroad has justified
individuals using force on their own terms. The fact that violence by government is seen as morally
justified, is the reason why violence will increase when the big financial crisis hits and becomes a
political crisis as well.</p>

<p>First, we recognize that individuals shouldn’t initiate violence, then we give the authority to
government. Eventually, the immoral use of government violence, when things goes badly, will be
used to justify an individual’s “right” to do the same thing. Neither the government nor individuals have
the moral right to initiate violence against another yet we are moving toward the day when both will
claim this authority. If this cycle is not reversed society will break down.</p>

<p>When needs are pressing, conditions deteriorate and rights become relative to the demands and the
whims of the majority. It’s then not a great leap for individuals to take it upon themselves to use
violence to get what they claim is theirs. As the economy deteriorates and the wealth discrepancies
increase—as are already occurring— violence increases as those in need take it in their own hands to
get what they believe is theirs. They will not wait for a government rescue program.</p>

<p>When government officials wield power over others to bail out the special interests, even with
disastrous results to the average citizen, they feel no guilt for the harm they do. Those who take us
into undeclared wars with many casualties resulting, never lose sleep over the death and destruction
their bad decisions caused. They are convinced that what they do is morally justified, and the fact that
many suffer just can’t be helped.</p>

<p>When the street criminals do the same thing, they too have no remorse, believing they are only taking
what is rightfully theirs. All moral standards become relative. Whether it’s bailouts, privileges,
government subsidies or benefits for some from inflating a currency, it’s all part of a process justified
by a philosophy of forced redistribution of wealth. Violence, or a threat of such, is the instrument
required and unfortunately is of little concern of most members of Congress.</p>

<p>Some argue it’s only a matter of “fairness” that those in need are cared for. There are two problems
with this. First, the principle is used to provide a greater amount of benefits to the rich than the poor.
Second, no one seems to be concerned about whether or not it’s fair to those who end up paying for
the benefits. The costs are usually placed on the backs of the middle class and are hidden from the
public eye. Too many people believe government handouts are free, like printing money out of thin air,
and there is no cost. That deception is coming to an end. The bills are coming due and that’s what the
economic slowdown is all about.</p>

<p>Sadly, we have become accustomed to living with the illegitimate use of force by government. It is the
tool for telling the people how to live, what to eat and drink, what to read and how to spend their
money.</p>

<p>To develop a truly free society, the issue of initiating force must be understood and rejected. Granting
to government even a small amount of force is a dangerous concession.</p>

<p>Our Constitution, which was intended to limit government power and abuse, has failed. The Founders
warned that a free society depends on a virtuous and moral people. The current crisis reflects that
their concerns were justified.</p>

<p>Most politicians and pundits are aware of the problems we face but spend all their time in trying to
reform government. The sad part is that the suggested reforms almost always lead to less freedom
and the importance of a virtuous and moral people is either ignored, or not understood. The new
reforms serve only to further undermine liberty. The compounding effect has given us this steady
erosion of liberty and the massive expansion of debt. The real question is: if it is liberty we seek,
should most of the emphasis be placed on government reform or trying to understand what “a virtuous
and moral people” means and how to promote it. The Constitution has not prevented the people from
demanding handouts for both rich and poor in their efforts to reform the government, while ignoring
the principles of a free society. All branches of our government today are controlled by individuals who
use their power to undermine liberty and enhance the welfare/warfare state-and frequently their own
wealth and power.</p>

<p>If the people are unhappy with the government performance it must be recognized that government is
merely a reflection of an immoral society that rejected a moral government of constitutional limitations
of power and love of freedom.</p>

<p>If this is the problem all the tinkering with thousands of pages of new laws and regulations will do
nothing to solve the problem.</p>

<p>It is self-evident that our freedoms have been severely limited and the apparent prosperity we still
have, is nothing more than leftover wealth from a previous time. This fictitious wealth based on debt
and benefits from a false trust in our currency and credit, will play havoc with our society when the
bills come due. This means that the full consequence of our lost liberties is yet to be felt.</p>

<p>But that illusion is now ending. Reversing a downward spiral depends on accepting a new approach.</p>

<p>Expect the rapidly expanding homeschooling movement to play a significant role in the revolutionary
reforms needed to build a free society with Constitutional protections. We cannot expect a Federal
government controlled school system to provide the intellectual ammunition to combat the dangerous
growth of government that threatens our liberties.</p>

<p>The internet will provide the alternative to the government/media complex that controls the news and
most political propaganda. This is why it’s essential that the internet remains free of government
regulation.</p>

<p>Many of our religious institutions and secular organizations support greater dependency on the state
by supporting war, welfare and corporatism and ignore the need for a virtuous people.</p>

<p>I never believed that the world or our country could be made more free by politicians, if the people had
no desire for freedom.</p>

<p>Under the current circumstances the most we can hope to achieve in the political process is to use it
as a podium to reach the people to alert them of the nature of the crisis and the importance of their
need to assume responsibility for themselves, if it is liberty that they truly seek. Without this, a
constitutionally protected free society is impossible.</p>

<p>If this is true, our individual goal in life ought to be for us to seek virtue and excellence and recognize
that self-esteem and happiness only comes from using one’s natural ability, in the most productive
manner possible, according to one’s own talents.</p>

<p>Productivity and creativity are the true source of personal satisfaction. Freedom, and not dependency,
provides the environment needed to achieve these goals. Government cannot do this for us; it only
gets in the way. When the government gets involved, the goal becomes a bailout or a subsidy and
these cannot provide a sense of personal achievement.</p>

<p>Achieving legislative power and political influence should not be our goal. Most of the change, if it is to
come, will not come from the politicians, but rather from individuals, family, friends, intellectual leaders
and our religious institutions. The solution can only come from rejecting the use of coercion,
compulsion, government commands, and aggressive force, to mold social and economic behavior.
Without accepting these restraints, inevitably the consensus will be to allow the government to
mandate economic equality and obedience to the politicians who gain power and promote an
environment that smothers the freedoms of everyone. It is then that the responsible individuals who
seek excellence and self-esteem by being self-reliance and productive, become the true victims.</p>

<p>What are the greatest dangers that the American people face today and impede the goal of a free
society? There are five.</p>

<p>1. The continuous attack on our civil liberties which threatens the rule of law and our ability to
resist the onrush of tyranny.</p>

<p>2. Violent anti-Americanism that has engulfed the world. Because the phenomenon of “blow-
back” is not understood or denied, our foreign policy is destined to keep us involved in many
wars that we have no business being in. National bankruptcy and a greater threat to our
national security will result.</p>

<p>3. The ease in which we go to war, without a declaration by Congress, but accepting
international authority from the UN or NATO even for preemptive wars, otherwise known as
aggression.</p>

<p>4. A financial political crisis as a consequence of excessive debt, unfunded liabilities,
spending, bailouts, and gross discrepancy in wealth distribution going from the middle class
to the rich. The danger of central economic planning, by the Federal Reserve must be
understood.</p>

<p>5. World government taking over local and US sovereignty by getting involved in the issues
of war, welfare, trade, banking, a world currency, taxes, property ownership, and private
ownership of guns.</p>

<p>Happily, there is an answer for these very dangerous trends.</p>

<p>What a wonderful world it would be if everyone accepted the simple moral premise of rejecting all acts
of aggression. The retort to such a suggestion is always: it’s too simplistic, too idealistic, impractical,
naïve, utopian, dangerous, and unrealistic to strive for such an ideal.</p>

<p>The answer to that is that for thousands of years the acceptance of government force, to rule over the
people, at the sacrifice of liberty, was considered moral and the only available option for achieving
peace and prosperity.</p>

<p>What could be more utopian than that myth—considering the results especially looking at the state
sponsored killing, by nearly every government during the 20th Century, estimated to be in the
hundreds of millions. It’s time to reconsider this grant of authority to the state.</p>

<p>No good has ever come from granting monopoly power to the state to use aggression against the
people to arbitrarily mold human behavior. Such power, when left unchecked, becomes the seed of
an ugly tyranny. This method of governance has been adequately tested, and the results are in:
reality dictates we try liberty.</p>

<p>The idealism of non-aggression and rejecting all offensive use of force should be tried. The idealism
of government sanctioned violence has been abused throughout history and is the primary source of
poverty and war. The theory of a society being based on individual freedom has been around for a
long time. It’s time to take a bold step and actually permit it by advancing this cause, rather than
taking a step backwards as some would like us to do.</p>

<p>Today the principle of habeas corpus, established when King John signed the Magna Carta in 1215, is
under attack. There’s every reason to believe that a renewed effort with the use of the internet that we
can instead advance the cause of liberty by spreading an uncensored message that will serve to rein
in government authority and challenge the obsession with war and welfare.</p>

<p>What I’m talking about is a system of government guided by the moral principles of peace and
tolerance.</p>

<p>The Founders were convinced that a free society could not exist without a moral people. Just writing
rules won’t work if the people choose to ignore them. Today the rule of law written in the Constitution
has little meaning for most Americans, especially those who work in Washington DC.</p>

<p>Benjamin Franklin claimed “only a virtuous people are capable of freedom.” John Adams concurred:
“Our Constitution was made for a moral and religious people. It is wholly inadequate to the
government of any other.”</p>

<p>A moral people must reject all violence in an effort to mold people’s beliefs or habits.</p>

<p>A society that boos or ridicules the Golden Rule is not a moral society. All great religions endorse the
Golden Rule. The same moral standards that individuals are required to follow should apply to all
government officials. They cannot be exempt.</p>

<p>The ultimate solution is not in the hands of the government.</p>

<p>The solution falls on each and every individual, with guidance from family, friends and community.</p>

<p>The #1 responsibility for each of us is to change ourselves with hope that others will follow. This is of
greater importance than working on changing the government; that is secondary to promoting a
virtuous society. If we can achieve this, then the government will change.</p>

<p>It doesn’t mean that political action or holding office has no value. At times it does nudge policy in the
right direction. But what is true is that when seeking office is done for personal aggrandizement,
money or power, it becomes useless if not harmful. When political action is taken for the right reasons
14/15it’s easy to understand why compromise should be avoided. It also becomes clear why progress is
best achieved by working with coalitions, which bring people together, without anyone sacrificing his
principles.</p>

<p>Political action, to be truly beneficial, must be directed toward changing the hearts and minds of the
people, recognizing that it’s the virtue and morality of the people that allow liberty to flourish.</p>

<p>The Constitution or more laws per se, have no value if the people’s attitudes aren’t changed.</p>

<p>To achieve liberty and peace, two powerful human emotions have to be overcome. Number one is
“envy” which leads to hate and class warfare. Number two is “intolerance” which leads to bigoted and
judgmental policies. These emotions must be replaced with a much better understanding of love,
compassion, tolerance and free market economics. Freedom, when understood, brings people
together. When tried, freedom is popular.</p>

<p>The problem we have faced over the years has been that economic interventionists are swayed by
envy, whereas social interventionists are swayed by intolerance of habits and lifestyles. The
misunderstanding that tolerance is an endorsement of certain activities, motivates many to legislate
moral standards which should only be set by individuals making their own choices. Both sides use
force to deal with these misplaced emotions. Both are authoritarians. Neither endorses voluntarism.</p>

<p>Both views ought to be rejected.</p>

<p>I have come to one firm conviction after these many years of trying to figure out “the plain truth of
things.” The best chance for achieving peace and prosperity, for the maximum number of people
world-wide, is to pursue the cause of LIBERTY.</p>

<p>If you find this to be a worthwhile message, spread it throughout the land.</p>

<p>And I yield back the balance of my time.</p>
